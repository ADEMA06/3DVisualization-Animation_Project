This repository consists in a project submitted for Three-Dimensional Visualization and Animation (2021/2022), a master's degree curricular subject of CS Degree at IST. This course introduced design and development techniques for 3D real-time interactive applications by using graphic APIs such as Modern OpenGL and WebGL.
The focus of the project was in developing an interactive 3D low-cost game, while applying the concepts learned during the theoretical classes, such as shaders, materials, stencil testing, among others.

This project was done in cooperation with @timafonso and @JoaoSilva2.
